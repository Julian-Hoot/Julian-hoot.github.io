		<h3><b>Artist Statement</b></h3>
		<p>
Power, emotion, and raw unfiltered energy are the mediums in which I choose to make the deepest parts of myself known to the world. As a metal musician, producer, and engineer, I always strive to make these three things the priority. They are important in every step of the creative process, whether I am writing, arranging, producing, or mixing.
<br/>
<br/>
I am a firm believer that the fine details can make or break a record. The delivery of a vocal, the presence of a guitar tone, or the impact of a snare drum can all drastically change the emotional content of a song. I always aspire to hone in those finer details for the sake of the music.
<br/>
<br/>
Wherever I may be leaving my mark on a piece of music, the writing, the production, or the mix, I always keep the three most important things in mind: the power, the emotion, and the energy.
